# Rich Progress Implementation Plan
# Status: In Progress
# Date: 2024-02-01

## 1. Remove TQDM Dependency
- [x] Delete TQDM imports from runner.py
- [x] Delete TQDM imports from processors
- [x] Remove TQDM from pyproject.toml dependencies
- [x] Remove TQDM from requirements files

## 2. Rich Progress Bar Implementation
- [x] Add Rich imports to runner.py:
  ```python
  from rich.progress import Progress, SpinnerColumn, BarColumn, TextColumn, TimeElapsedColumn
  ```
- [x] Replace source processing loop with Rich progress:
  ```python
  with Progress(
      SpinnerColumn(),
      TextColumn("[progress.description]{task.description}"),
      BarColumn(),
      TextColumn("[progress.percentage]{task.percentage:>3.0f}%"),
      TimeElapsedColumn(),
      expand=True,
      transient=False,  # Keep progress bars visible
  ) as progress:
      source_task = progress.add_task("[cyan]Processing Sources...", total=len(sources))
  ```
- [x] Add inner progress bars for processor operations
  - Added progress tracking to base processor
  - Added attachment counting in Bear processor
  - Added nested progress bars for attachments
  - Added progress updates for cached items
- [x] Test progress display with various source types
  - Implemented color-coded status messages
  - Added progress tracking for cached items
  - Added proper error state indication

## 3. RichHandler Logging Integration
- [x] Verify RichHandler setup in log_setup.py
- [x] Test logging interleaving with progress bars
  - Added ProgressAwareHandler class
  - Added global progress tracking
  - Added console sharing between progress and logging
- [x] Verify log levels display correctly
  - Added proper log level handling
  - Added third-party logger configuration
  - Added file logging with rotation

## 4. Summary Output Implementation
- [x] Create metric rows definition
- [x] Implement print_detailed_summary function with Rich Table
- [x] Add error reporting section
- [x] Add per-processor statistics tracking
  - Added ProcessorStats dataclass
  - Added per-processor error tracking
  - Added stats merging support
  - Added unassociated error handling
- [x] Test summary display with sample data
  - Added color-coded error sections
  - Added proper error categorization
  - Added clear error attribution

## 5. Integration in main.py
- [x] Remove TQDM references
- [x] Import and call print_detailed_summary
- [x] Test full execution flow
  - Added progress-aware logging setup
  - Added proper cleanup in finally block
  - Added error handling for processor failures

## 6. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for progress display
- [ ] Unit tests for summary generation
- [ ] Integration tests for full workflow
- [ ] Test error handling and display
- [ ] Test with various terminal sizes
- [ ] Test with different log levels

## 7. Documentation
- [ ] Update docstrings
- [ ] Update README with new output examples
- [ ] Document Rich-specific configuration options
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues

## 8. Final Verification
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify output formatting
- [ ] Check error handling
- [ ] Validate progress display
- [ ] Test with different terminal types
- [ ] Performance comparison with TQDM version

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing suite
2. Update documentation
3. Final verification
4. Performance testing

## Notes
- All progress reporting now uses Rich
- Consistent styling across all output
- Clear error visibility in summary
- Improved user experience with unified display
- Progress bars now show:
  - Main source processing progress
  - Per-note progress within each source
  - Attachment processing progress
  - Color-coded status messages
  - Cache hit/miss status
- Logging improvements:
  - Progress-aware logging
  - Proper log level handling
  - Rotating file logs
  - Third-party logger configuration
- Statistics tracking:
  - Per-processor statistics
  - Detailed error attribution
  - Unassociated error handling
  - Proper stats merging
